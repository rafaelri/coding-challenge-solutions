# rafaelri's coding challenges
Repository with my solutions to a few coding challenges available on various online platforms.
## Running
Currently (I guess) all are coded with python and there are tests along the solutions (a few were coded test driven).
There is a requirements.txt containing the required packages (pip install -r requirements.txt and you are fine) 
I usually code with pytest-watch but since the code is complete it won't make much difference for anyone reading my codes even though I strongly recommend using pytest-watch (simply run ptw and listen for console beeps everytime a test fails)
